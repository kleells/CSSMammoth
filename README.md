## Tech Used

## Dependencies
None. Viewer only need to utilze Live Server through the index.html file.

## Uses
To practice and style a HTML file with CSS. This project offered some clarification on certain CSS consepts (padding vs. margin, id being unique vs. classes being reused, @media and -ms-flex)

## How I veered from the original project

## History
After completing a Software Engineering certification program and during my job search, I needed to continue to pracitce my skill set in order to maintain it and learn more. I thought that even the most basic projects using the most basic languages was a great place to start.
